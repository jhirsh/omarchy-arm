# Omarchy ARM64 installer.
#
# Upstream Omarchy is installed from an ISO that pacstraps a fixed package set
# onto a fresh x86_64 disk. That ISO does not exist for aarch64, and the
# packages it would pull are not built for it, so this fork installs onto an
# Arch Linux ARM system that is already running:
#
#   - an Apple Silicon Mac under Asahi's Arch Linux ARM port
#   - a Raspberry Pi 5 under Arch Linux ARM
#   - an aarch64 virtual machine under Arch Linux ARM
#
# Run it from a checkout of this repository, as your normal user or as root on
# a fresh image, where it creates the user first and carries on as them:
#
#   ./install.sh --dry-run     # print the whole plan, change nothing
#   ./install.sh
#   ./install.sh --user jonas  # as root: create jonas, then install as jonas
#
# See docs/arm64-port.md for what differs from upstream and why.

Usage: ./install.sh [options]

Installs Omarchy onto a running Arch Linux ARM (aarch64) system.

Options:
  --dry-run          Print every action without changing anything
  -y, --yes          Do not prompt for confirmation
  --skip-packages    Leave package installation to you entirely
  --with-aur         Also install the packages that only exist in the AUR.
                     Off by default: on aarch64 every one of them is compiled
                     on this machine, and one pulls in a Zig and LLVM
                     toolchain that needs several GB and a long build
  --no-aur           Keep every AUR package out, including the three the
                     desktop needs (the terminal launcher and mise, which
                     installs the AI CLIs). Leaves a degraded desktop
  --target DIR       Where Omarchy is installed (default: $TARGET)
  --user NAME        When run as root: create NAME with sudo rights, then
                     re-run this installer as NAME. A fresh Arch Linux ARM
                     image has no such user, so this is how it gets one.
                     Prompted for when omitted
  --link             Point the target at this checkout with a symlink instead
                     of copying it, for working on the fork itself
  --profile NAME     Override hardware detection: apple-silicon,
                     raspberry-pi-5, raspberry-pi or generic-aarch64
  -h, --help         Show this message
